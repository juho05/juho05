## üëã Hello, world! üåé

Hi, I am Julian, a student from Germany. I enjoy working on fun projects in my free time. 

Some examples of what I have been working on:
- a [music streaming service](https://github.com/juho05/crossonic) for your own media files
- an [OpenID Connect identity provider](https://github.com/juho05/h-id)
- a [custom programming language for mBot2 robots](https://github.com/juho05/embe)
- a [dynamic interpreted programming language](https://github.com/juho05/crab)
- a [webapp for digital allowance management](https://github.com/juho05/h-bank)
- some experiments with the [Mandelbrot set](https://github.com/juho05/fractals) and [Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/juho05/golminator)
- [various projects](https://github.com/orgs/code-game-project/repositories) for [CodeGame](https://github.com/orgs/code-game-project), an ecosystem for programmatically controllable multiplayer games
